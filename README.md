# Combating Collusion Rings is Hard but Possible

This repository contains the code for the experiments published in "Niclas Boehmer, Robert Bredereck, and Andr√© Nichterlein. Combating Collusion Rings is Hard but Possible. AAAI 2022. Accepted for Publication".

The real-world data that we use in the experiments (iclr2018.npz) was collected by Xu, Zhao, Shi, and Shah, [On Strategyproof Conference Peer Review](https://github.com/xycforgithub/StrategyProof_Conference_Review). 

To execute the code a working version of python3 and gurobi (https://www.gurobi.com/) is needed. 

To reproduce our experiments, please run: 
python3 main.py
